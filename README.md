# Portfolio Site in Hono

I decided to build a portfolio site, but wasn't sure what tech stack I wanted to use.
I've mostly built websites in PHP and Go, but wanted to do more in JavaScript/TypeScript outside of legacy Express/Koa
projects from work.
[Hono](https://hono.dev) caught my attention, and so I decided to start building a portfolio site with it.
Full disclaimer I'm not sure if this will reach 100% completion and be deployed.
It might just end up being something for me to go back to as a reference, or the portfolio site might end up being built
with a technology I'm more familiar with.

## Getting Started

If you want to clone the repo and run it locally, you only need to run two commands:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080
